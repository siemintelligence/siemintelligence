Snort is the foremost Open Source Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) in the world. Snort IPS uses a series of rules that help define malicious network activity and uses those rules to find packets that match against them and generates alerts for users.

Certified Snort Professional training demonstrates how to deploy Snort in small to enterprise scale implementations. Participants will learn how to install, configure, and operate Snort in Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) modes. You will practice installing and configuring Snort, utilising additional software tools, defining rules to configure and improving the Snort environment, and more.

This training also includes understanding network security's basic components, constructing a dual-firewall DMZ, and defining security policies to implement and enforce these rules. After then, we will go in-depth on the popular Linux firewall. Finally, we will learn about Network IDS and Host IDS, including a deep dive into Snort.
This course is designed for information security professionals who need to know how to deploy open-source intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) and write Snort rules.
